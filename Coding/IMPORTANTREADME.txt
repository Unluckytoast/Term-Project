Dear Dr. Owen,

    I am writing in this file to make sure that it is understood that I have
    used generative AI throughout the course of this project. I have not used
    it on every file I have worked on, however, I have used it enough to help me 
    with parts of the project from formatting to both syntax and logical errors 
    that it needs to be noted. As I stated in my reflection, I do not know all 
    of the files in which I used AI, so rather than write a comment at the top 
    of every file it was decided that this would be more effecient. If you are
    reading this first (prior to my reflection), feel free to not read past
    the point in which it says "proud of", as that is when this point is repeated.
    Thank you for your time!

Sincerely,
Jada Carter
